Ok, guys, we've got a plenty to do.
First, congrats for dealing with GIT. It's not as that easy ;)
Next, we'll divide our work. Check here this evening for futher instruction!

Our formule to work with:
w_{t,d}=\frac{log(1+tf_{t,d})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i,d}^{2}}}*\frac{N}{df_{t}}
it's LATEX, you can visualize it here:
